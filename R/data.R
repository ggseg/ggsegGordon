#' These parcels had highly homogenous RSFC patterns, 
#' indicating that they contained one unique RSFC signal; 
#' furthermore, the parcels were much more homogenous than a 
#' null model matched for parcel size when tested in two separate datasets. 
#' Several alternative parcellation schemes were tested this way, and no 
#' other parcellation was as homogenous as or had as large a difference compared 
#' with its null model.
#' annot files were acquired from (\href{https://github.com/faskowit/multiAtlasTT}{faskowit/multiAtlasTT})
